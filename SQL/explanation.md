My thought process was mostly on auto pilot as this is something I have done many times.

When designing a new system, I like to include columns for standard items like the date the row was added, who added the row, when the row was last updated, the status of the row, and an identity column. These can aid in troubleshooting and debugging.

Some of these values could be set by a trigger on insert and update.

I was not sure if you intended this CMS system to include accounting. Years ago, I think that a CMS would have accounting function but these days it seems like a CMS just interfaces to an accounting system.

Thank you for the opportunity to show you some of my coding skills.
