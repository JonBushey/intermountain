FizzBuzz project.

I assumed that when the instructions said "if the number is divisible by 5" that it
was intended to mean "evenly" divisible by 5 because any number can be divided by 5.

I was also not sure what meant by "function". COBOL does not have functions and so
I assumed that what was meant was create a program.

I did this project in COBOL. I believe it will work with any version of COBOL.

It can be compiled and run by visiting this web page:
