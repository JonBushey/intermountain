To compile this game, you need Clarion version 10. However, I have already created an exe for running my game. If you wish to compile, just ask me and I can provide you my personal laptop that has the environment to compile this source code.

This game was designed to run on a tablet, namely the ThinkPad X1 Yoga. My work computer is this device and I have already loaded the exe on the machine if you wish to see it run as a tablet app. It will also run on a Windows machine.

I was going to add sound effects and a recorded voice that would announce the winner but I ran out of time. I was also going to make use of the OK button to restart the game so the user could play again but I ran out of time.
